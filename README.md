## Project

This project will focus on mainly drought conditions in Turkey. Reanlyses and observation data setes will be used to understand what are the differences and similarities between data sets, and regional forecasting/modelling data sets will be used to estimate drought conditions in the future. As a part of big PhD thesis, these all will help to improve the polciy side of drought management. There are some questions to be aware of what we want to focus on. 

Qs:

1. Drought monitoring is the most commonly evaluated by drought index, but some of them is not applicable for certain areas. What is the best one for Turkey or Mediterranean region?

2. Will we achieve same results with observations and reanlyses over the intented project area?

3. What is the best way to manipulate and make the observation data sets ready? 

4.
